# Installation

First, we set the locale for the system to UTF-8.

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.

First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Then add the repository to your sources list.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

Update and upgrade your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
