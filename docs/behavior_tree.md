# Creating a Behavior Tree

 **Create Two Behavior Trees:**
   - Create two behavior trees: one for navigation through poses and the other for navigation to a pose.
   - The naming convention for these files should be `poses.xml` and `pose.xml` respectively.
   - Place all the behavior tree files in a single folder. Add the path to this file in the main configuration file. 

By following these steps, you can create behavior trees tailored to any of your controller or planner functionality. Make sure to customize the behavior trees based on the control logic and requirements of your specific controller.
